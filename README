    to live server:
    go to directory -> /library/Models/Iscriptz/IConnect2Db.php
    change the following constant values:
        CLIENTHOST = 'localhost',
        CLIENTUSER = 'user',
        CLIENTPW = 'password',

###################################### ERROR REPORTING CONFIGURATION #########################################
Error Reporting Configuration has 2 steps that should be completed before live production

1. Turn error reporting for PHP and MySQL off via /public/index
Either comment out lines 5 & 6 or delete them before pushing changes to live production.
Example:
    5. error_reporting(E_ALL);// show all php errors
    6. ini_set('display_errors', 'On'); // show errors
These lines should be commented out by default, via the .sh upload configuration file.
But as a precaution you should confirm before moving to production.

2. Make sure that the hosting server has error reporting turn on via the php.ini and/or httpd.conf files.

###################################  MERCURIAL .hginore CONFIGURATION #######################################
In the .hgignore file you will find by default the following:
"tests" directory for the phpunit testing
"phpunit.xml"

################################### APPLICATION SASS CONFIGURATION #######################################
SASS is running in directory "assets/styles/app.scss".

In order to run the SASS compiler from the command line
you have to target the "app.css" file that is located in "public/resources/css/app.css" by entering
the following on the command line
"your/path/to/your/project/directory/project_name$ sass public/assets/styles/app.scss public/resources/css/app.css"

If you wish to run the SASS compiler automatically so that you don't have to type the above command in over and over,
you can use SASS's "--watch" option that checks for changes made to the "public/assets/styles/app.scss" file.

This can be accomplished by running the following in the command line:
"your/path/to/your/project/directory/project_name$ sass --watch public/assets/styles/app.scss:public/resources/css/app.css".
Please notice that the --watch option includes the ":" that connects the two files.

#### MINIFY WITH SASS
If you desire to minify the app.css you can add the following "--style compressed" option to the sass "--watch".
Example: project_name$ sass --watch --style compressed public/assets/styles/app.scss:public/resources/css/app.css"
