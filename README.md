This is the core template / theme that serves as a the base template for all other templates being designed using getMarvelle.com

## getMarvelle.com
getMarvelle was created by Marvin Dawson, PHP Software Engineer, on March 1, 2017.


### The Birth
The purpose of getMarvelle.com was to design a PHP CMS that was simple to use and well honestly, something I created.
Currently there are 3 themed templates being design that originated from getMarvelle.com.

The idea originated from the countless projects that I was solicited for creation and some just fizzled out.

Ultimately I ended up with several different projects all a little bit different.  So I combined those many projects to make one template.

### The Approach 
Make a template that was so basic that it didn't require any thought to what needed to be done, in theory.
